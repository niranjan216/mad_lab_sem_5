Overview
This project contains multiple experiments focused on different aspects of mobile application development. These experiments include implementations of a secure login system, dynamic font change functionality, a basic calculator, and credential verification methods. Each experiment is designed to be modular, allowing you to integrate them into your projects easily.

Features

*1. Login System*
Description:
The login system is designed with security in mind. It includes the following features:

Username and Password Validation: Ensures that users enter valid credentials.
Error Handling: Provides feedback for incorrect login attempts.
Session Management: Maintains user sessions securely.
Usage:
Users can log in using their username and password. Upon successful login, they are redirected to the main application screen. If the credentials are incorrect, an error message will be displayed.

*2. Font Change Functionality*
Description:
This feature allows users to dynamically change the font style and size in the application.

Predefined Font Styles: Includes a selection of popular fonts.
Custom Font Sizes: Users can adjust the font size to their preference.
Real-time Preview: Users can see changes immediately.
Usage:
Navigate to the settings menu and choose the "Font Settings" option. From there, select a font style and size that suits your needs.

*3. Calculator*
Description:
A simple, yet functional calculator built into the application.

Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
User-friendly Interface: Designed with ease of use in mind.
Usage:
Access the calculator from the main menu. Enter numbers and select the desired operation to perform calculations.

*4. Connection Establishment*
Description
Establishing a connection to a database is the first step in enabling an application to perform database operations. This involves specifying connection parameters such as the database type, server address, database name, username, and password.
Usage
To establish a connection, follow these steps:
Choose a Database Driver: Select the appropriate driver for the database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
Configure Connection Parameters: Set up the necessary parameters, including:
Database Type: Specify the type of database (e.g., MySQL, Oracle).
Server Address: Provide the hostname or IP address of the database server.
Database Name: Indicate the specific database to connect to.

*5. Credential Verification*
Description:
Enhances the security of the login system by verifying credentials.

Email Verification: Sends a verification link to the user's email upon registration.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Optional feature for additional security.
Password Strength Checker: Ensures users create strong passwords.
Usage:
Users are required to verify their email address during registration. For enhanced security, 2FA can be enabled from the security settings.

*6. Overview of TSS and STT*
Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) are essential technologies that enhance user interaction within applications by converting text into spoken words and vice versa. These functionalities can significantly improve accessibility and user experience.

Text-to-Speech (TTS)
Description
TTS technology transforms written text into audible speech, enabling applications to read content aloud. This is particularly beneficial for users who prefer auditory information or have reading difficulties.
Key Features
Natural Voice Generation: Modern TTS systems utilize advanced algorithms to produce human-like voices, enhancing the listening experience.
Wide Application: TTS is used in virtual assistants, educational tools, and accessibility applications for visually impaired users.
Usage in the Application
Incorporating TTS allows the application to provide auditory feedback, read notifications, or assist users in navigating through text-heavy content. This can be implemented using various TTS engines, such as Google TTS or Microsoft Azure TTS.

Speech-to-Text (STT)
Description
STT technology converts spoken language into written text, facilitating transcription and enabling voice commands within applications. This technology is crucial for creating accessible interfaces and enhancing user interaction.
Key Features
Real-time Transcription: STT systems can transcribe spoken words into text almost instantaneously, which is beneficial for live captioning and note-taking.
Language Support: Many STT systems support multiple languages, making them versatile for global applications. For instance, Microsoft Azure Speech to Text supports over 100 languages.
Integration with Voice Commands: STT can be used to enable voice-controlled features, allowing users to interact with the application hands-free.
Usage in the Application
Integrating STT into the application can allow users to dictate messages, control app functions, or transcribe audio recordings. This enhances usability, particularly in scenarios where typing is impractical.

Implementation Considerations
Technical Setup
To implement TTS and STT in the application, developers should consider the following:
Choosing the Right API: Select a TTS/STT API that fits the application's needs. Popular options include Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Microsoft Azure Speech, and ElevenLabs for TTS.
Handling Errors and Edge Cases: Implement robust error handling to manage issues like unrecognized speech or API failures.
User Experience Design: Ensure that the integration of TTS and STT is seamless and intuitive for users, providing clear instructions and feedback.
